# Advance-Model-SVM-with-exercises. 
Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a robust classification and regression technique that maximizes the predictive accuracy of a model without overfitting the training data. SVM is particularly suited to analyzing data with very large numbers (for example, thousands) of predictor fields.

SVM has applications in many disciplines, including customer relationship management (CRM), facial and other image recognition, bioinformatics, text mining concept extraction, intrusion detection, protein structure prediction, and voice and speech recognition.

Using Python an Jupyter Notebook - 

Import the leukemia.csv data file.

Partition data 70-30.

Reclassify all classes into binary classes. 'cancer' and 'healthy'

Standardize the input variables with a z-transformation.

Build a classification model with the SVM Linear, SVM RBF, and SVM Polynomial with default hyperparameters.

Which model gives the highest accuracy?


SVM supports the following kernel types:

Linear - recommended when linear separation of the data is straightforward.
Polynomial
Radial basis function (RBF)
Sigmoid

You will need to experiment with the different functions to obtain the best model in each case, as they each use different algorithms and parameters.
